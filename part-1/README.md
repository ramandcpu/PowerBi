To connect Power BI to a MySQL database like the one from https://github.com/ramandcpu/SQL/tree/main/mysql, follow these steps:

1. Open Power BI Desktop and click on "Get Data" from the Home ribbon.

2. In the Get Data window, select "MySQL Database" from the categories on the left.

3. In the MySQL Database window, enter the Server and Database name for your MySQL instance. You can also specify the Data Connectivity mode (Import or DirectQuery) based on your needs.

4. Click "OK" and enter your credentials (username and password) to authenticate with the MySQL server.

5. If the connection is successful, you'll see the Navigator window listing all the available tables and views in the database. Select the ones you want to import and click "Load" or "Transform Data" if you need to apply any transformations.

6. The selected tables will now load into Power BI Desktop as separate queries. You can start building visualizations and reports using this data.

A few important points:

- Make sure the MySQL server is accessible from the machine running Power BI Desktop. You may need to configure firewall rules or use an on-premises data gateway if the database is not publicly accessible.

- For large datasets, it's recommended to use DirectQuery mode to avoid loading all data into Power BI Desktop's memory.

- You can also connect using a connection string by selecting "Advanced options" in the MySQL Database window.

- Power BI supports MySQL versions 5.7 and above.
